# TypeScript-Boilerplate

A basic boilerplate to get started using a login/register script with alt:V

## Installation

To install all dependencies just enter the following:

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

Best practice is to use 3 terminal windows. (I prefer using [cmder](https://cmder.net/) on Windows)

```text
npm run build:server:watch //Build server files on the fly
npm run build:client:watch //Build client files on the fly
npm run copy:meta // Copy files like .html, .js, .css
```
